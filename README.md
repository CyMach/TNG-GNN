**Summary of the work**

->The GCN developed in this study, trained on a vast dataset of 16 million nodes and 56 million edges.

->Aimed to optimize the foundational understanding of galactic dynamics across diverse data distributions.

->The work uses galaxy cutout data extracted from the TNG simulation to construct a detailed graph framework.

->Implemented graph convolutional neural network architecture is trained to estimate the dark matter properties within a galaxy cutout from an n-body simulation.

->Using neural networks for dark matter classification through cosmic web analysis and simulated datasets.



Central to this effort was the prediction of gravitational potential - a critical parameter for quantifying gravitational lensing effects based on coordinates.

**Proposed System: Graph Neural Networks on n-body simulations**

->Analyzing the galaxy with Graph-structured data by itâ€™s distribution of matter. 

->Particles(n-body) as nodes. 

->Edges depicting spatial relationships between these nodes. 

->Learn features embedded for each node

**Graph Construction**

***Features Tensor***

->Coordinates: Position of particles (x,y,z)

Every particle is a node, there are 16,35,470 so total 16,35,470 nodes.


***Targets tensor***

->SubfindDMDensity : Density of all DM particles within a radius of SubfindHsml

->SubfindDensity : Density of all BM particles within a radius of SubfindHsml

->SubfindHsml : The comoving radius of the sphere centered on each particle

->Potential : Gravitational potential of each particle. 

***Edges*** 

->5 Nearest Neighbors for each particle so 56,57,048 edges were made.


**3D Split**

->To partition the nodes of a graph into training, validation, and test sets based on their spatial coordinates within a 3-dimensional grid. 

->This approach begins by extracting the 3D coordinates of the nodes from the features tensor(coordinates)

->Next, calculate the minimum and maximum values along each coordinate axis, which define the spatial boundaries of the nodes. 

->These boundaries are essential for determining the extents of the 3D space that the nodes occupy. 

->By iterating over the number of grid cells in each dimension and calculating the boundaries for each cell, the entire space is divided into a grid of specific size (3x3x3)
